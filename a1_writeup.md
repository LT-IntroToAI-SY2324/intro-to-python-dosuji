# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?
Answer: My initial thouhts about the python programming language is that it seems easier to understand than Java in AP CS A, since the syntax is simplier and there is not a heavy neccessity for "SEMI-COLONS".


2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?
Answer: Similiarites- Python and Java are both object-oriented prgramming langauges with extensive standard libraries; both use functions that do not necessarily rely on class definitions being made.
Differences- Python is easier to understand, since it is more interpretable; Java is harder to understand/more complex in a sense since the syntax for Java is more tedious.


3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?
I learned that ChatGpt works wonders for programming and that I should find a new career before AI takes over. But on a more serious note, I have learned more about the way Python relates to Java and how to translate my Java thought process into a Python thought process.
